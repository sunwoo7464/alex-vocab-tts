* Start with a topic sentence for your second main point.
* Explain why it matters.
* Provide examples or details.
* Share your personal thoughts or feelings.

Body Paragraph 3
* Use a transition such as Finally / Lastly.
* Introduce your third main point in a topic sentence.
* Explain why that point is relevant.
* Give supporting details or examples.
