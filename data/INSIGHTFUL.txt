CONTEXT CLUES

WRITING SENTENCES USING CONTEXT CLUES



Context clues: hints that writers give to help define a difficult or an unusual word. Because most vocabulary is gained through reading, it is important to recognize context clues. 


* Examples: use examples to illustrate a word (such as, including, like)
Ex: When you go to an office party you should show your best decorum, for example, dress your best, eat moderately, and be sure you thank your host before you leave.


_________________________________________________________________


* Synonyms: words with the same or similar meaning
Ex: My opponent’s argument is fallacious, misleading, and wrong.


_________________________________________________________________


* Contrast + Antonyms: words that have opposite meanings (although, even 
though, on the other hand, whereas, in contrast, while)
Ex: Although some men are loquacious, others hardly talk at all.


_________________________________________________________________


* Explanation: an unknown word is explained
Ex: She is so somnolent that she needs medication to help her stay awake.


_________________________________________________________________
